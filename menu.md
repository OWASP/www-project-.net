OWASP .NET Project
------------------

The OWASP.NET Project is the clearinghouse for all information related to building secure .NET web applications and services. The goal of the project is to provide deep content for all roles related to .NET web applications and services.

The focus of the project is on guidance for developers using the framework, OWASP Components that use .NET, and participation in OWASP projects that use .NET.

Community content is key to security information. The project depends on content from developers throughout the .NET world. Check out the [OWASP .Net Project Roadmap](OWASP_.Net_Project_Roadmap "wikilink") for ways to get involved.

Purpose
-------

-   Provide deep, rich guidance for .NET developers in using the security features of .NET
-   Create guidance for use of OWASP components that are designed for use with .NET
-   Focus on information about working with and on OWASP tools built using .NET

Resources
=========

The .NET Project is principally about creating deep, rich guidance for NET developers using the Microsoft .NET Framework's security resources.

Detailed Guidance
-----------------

The following articles describe specific guidance for working with the .NET Framework.

Security Guidance
-----------------

The following sections include general content that can be useful for a specific role in securing .NET web applications and services:

The following sections include specific guidance for particular technological problems related to .NET web applications and services:

Road Map and Getting Involved
=============================

Overview
--------

The .NET Framework has seen significant security improvement over the last ten years of development. With proper use the core security problems that are seen in web applications, or even Windows executibles, are difficult to exploit.

The key is 'proper use' and that is the goal of the .NET Project - assist with proper use. Education, components and tools that are appropriate for the latest .NET versions should be the focus for output of this project. As tools and information become out of date, they will be moved to a sunset mode, still available to those using older versions of the framework.

Themes
------

The themes of the .NET Project include:

-   Deep, rich guidance for .NET developers using the security features of .NET
-   Access to use of OWASP components that are designed for use with .NET
-   Information about working with and on OWASP tools built using .NET

Features
--------

Features are parts of the project at a very high level. There are three themes, and they include guidance for developers, components that help to write more secure .NET projects, and tools for general security and testing written in .NET.

### Guidance

Guidance is documentation that assists .NET developers implementing the security features of the framework.

#### In-process guidance

-   [Windows Identity Foundation](Windows_Identity_Foundation "wikilink")
-   [.NET Memory Management](.NET_Memory_Management "wikilink")
-   [Adding two-factor authentication to ASP.NET](Adding_two-factor_authentication_to_ASP.NET "wikilink")

#### Needed guidance

-   [ASP.NET Identity](ASP.NET_Identity "wikilink")
-   [DPAPI](DPAPI "wikilink")
-   [ClickOnce Deployment](ClickOnce_Deployment "wikilink")
-   [.NET Callbacks - Vulnerabilities and Remediation](.NET_Callbacks_-_Vulnerabilities_and_Remediation "wikilink")
-   [Dependency Injection](Dependency_Injection "wikilink")
-   [IoC containers](IoC_containers "wikilink")
-   [Preventing SQL Injection in ADO.NET](Preventing_SQL_Injection_in_ADO.NET "wikilink")
-   [Authenticated Symmetric Encryption in .NET](Authenticated_Symmetric_Encryption_in_.NET "wikilink")

### Components

Components are pieces of software that assist .NET developers in building more secure code. A number of projects exist that are for older versions of .NET. While they are no longer valid for later versions, they are still acceptable for use. Many updates are needed to a number of other projects.

#### Needed Components

Please suggest needed components.

### Projects that use .NET

These are projects that happen to be built in .NET. Many of them could use .NET development assistance:

-   [OWASP O2 Platform](OWASP_O2_Platform "wikilink")
-   [WebGOAT.NET](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat.NET)

FAQs
====

Questions and answers
---------------------

Q1: Why are there so many empty projects?
A1: Because YOU haven't worked on them! We need your help!  

<!-- -->

Q2: Why the focus on specific implementation, rather than on general security? I just need general guidance!
A2: General guidance is platform independent. You should start with the awesome Cheat Sheets for general information. We are focused on specific implementation because these are the tough, unanswered questions that lead to the high risk vulnerabilities.  

<!-- -->

Q3: Where are the .NET specific security tools.
A3: Nearly everything you need is already in the .NET Framework. It's just a matter of learning where it is and how to use it. That's where the .NET project comes in.
